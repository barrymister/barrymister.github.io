Well life gets busy and I haven't really had time to even touch my blog/site.

Working on a few new interests both personally and professionally.

I passed the HAM Technician License Exam on July 1st and was in the FCC database on the 6th.

So I am a licensed amateur radio operator.

Call sign KQ4TNV.

At this very moment, although sidetracked with this update, I am working on cutomizing my XLX Reflector web page <a href="https://xlx556.kq4tnv.net/" target="_blank">XLX556 Multiprotocl Reflector in Stafford Virginia</a>
