# Where it started
I have been thinking back to the beginning of my career. At the time I do not think I realized what I would be doing professionally. I just wanted to do what I enjoyed. I was not thinking about making a living or marketable skills. I just know that building tiny websites with HTML and CSS was fun. I was not particularly good at it, I was just tinkering. At some point along the way I did try to turn my focus towards building web development into a business. This was mid-late nineties. I was still a philosophy student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and working as a News Editor for the student publication The Kaleidoscope. I remember some of the tools used, Quark Express, all MacIntosh PCs and servers. We used a paper board for the layout to model before entering the editor. That is what went to print. I delivered the papers as well. I was not very dependable at any of these responsibilities. But the thing I enjoyed was building the pages that were posted on the web version of the paper.

# Moving along
I did not stick with web development. Who knows what could have been. There have been times over the years that I have dabbled a bit here and there both at work and home for various purposes, self-hosted blogs, or inner office wikis. But my journey took me down the SysOps path. A truly rewarding career full of opportunities to sandbox and build and tinker with all the new hardware and tech that has come along over the last 25 years in this vast information technology ocean. I have built massive storage systems, robotic tape libraries, virtual clusters, hyperconverged solutions all so much fun, challenging work, but exciting. There is a dark side as well. I have consolidated a lot of people out of work, including myself. Those layoffs post VMware adoption, entire server rooms scaled down to one rack, then one server, then to the cloud.
