I put together a subdomain for my <a href="https://resume.barrymister.com/" target="_blank">resume</a>.

It's a work in progress.

Also, had a breakthrough on soemthing very challenging today.

Something I've been working very hard on and didn't know if I could figure it out.

But I did.

Feels good.

I haven't been able to dedicate any time to my other ventures.

Still trying to develop my business <a href="https://datacraftworks.com/" target="_blank">Data Craftworks, LLC</a>.

Trying to shore up the necessary administrative functions of both the LLC and the S corp I'm forming.

It's a lot. So much red tape and procedural work that has to be done to build a legit business.

But, I am loving it.
